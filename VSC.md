## Guide for using VSC if you are finding it hard to run here's how to do it:

1. Open a new terminal 
2. Run this command Python, -u "Where ever you have this file saved"
3. This should run, if it doesn't let us know in the Issues tab.

P.S if you don't know where the file run it in debug mode and 
vsc will say where the file is and you can copy and paste the location
